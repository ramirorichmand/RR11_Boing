Welcome to the Boing Game! This is a simple and addictive game where you control a character named "boing" and try to survive for as long as possible by avoiding obstacles. Challenge yourself, beat your highscore, and have fun!

It is built for educational purposes and to showcase the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in creating a simple game.
## Game Instructions

Instructions for playing the game:

When you open the game, you will see a message on the screen. Press the ⌨️ `SPACE` key to start the game.

Once the game starts, you will control a character called "boing" using the following controls:
   - Jump: Press the ⌨️ ``SPACE`` key, ⌨️ W key, or the ⬆️ Up Arrow key to make the character jump. Hold the `SPACE` key for a higher jump!
   - Pause: Press the ⌨️ `P` key or the ⌨️ `Escape` key to pause the game.
   - Reset: Press the ⌨️ `R` key to reset the game.
- 🎯 The objective of the game is to avoid colliding with the obstacles and survive for as long as possible.
- 🏃 The character will automatically move forward, and you need to time your jumps to avoid the obstacles.
- 🔢 Each time you successfully pass an obstacle without colliding, your score will increase by one.
- ❌ If you collide with an obstacle, the game will be over. You can press the ⌨️ `R` key to reset and start a new game.
- ⏸️ During gameplay, you can pause the game by pressing the ⌨️ `P` key or the ⌨️ `Escape` key. To resume, press the ⌨️ `P` key again.
- 🏆 The game keeps track of your highscore. If you beat your previous highscore, it will be saved.

## Additional features:

- 🌌 Gravity Effect: The game has a gravity effect, causing the character to fall down unless a jump is initiated.
