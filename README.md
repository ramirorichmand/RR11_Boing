# Boing Game Project

This project is an alternate version of the Dinosaur game found on the Chrome "No Internet" screen. The game is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following:

- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a blank webpage.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the game elements.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for game functionality.

## 👨‍💻 Development Steps

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Open the `index.html` file and set up the basic HTML structure for your game. This includes elements for the game canvas, score display, and any other necessary elements.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Open the `styles.css` file and define the styles for your game elements. You can customize the colors, sizes, and positioning of the game canvas, dinosaur, obstacles, and score display.

3. **JavaScript Game Logic**:
   - Open the `script.js` file and start implementing the game logic.
   - Create variables to store the necessary game data, such as the dinosaur's position, obstacle positions, and score.
   - Write functions to handle user input, such as jumping, and update the game state accordingly.
   - Implement collision detection between the dinosaur and the obstacles.
   - Update the score and display it on the screen.

4. **Event Listeners**:
   - Add event listeners to listen for keyboard input or mouse clicks to control the dinosaur's actions.

5. **Game Loop**:
   - Create a game loop using `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` to update the game state and render the game elements continuously.

6. **Game Over**:
   - Implement a game over condition, such as when the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.
   - Display a game over message and allow the player to restart the game.

7. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test the game thoroughly and make any necessary adjustments to improve gameplay and fix any bugs or issues.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Once you are satisfied with the game, you can deploy it by hosting the files on a web server or using a platform like GitHub Pages.
